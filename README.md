# neural-network-digit-recognition
This is a neural network matlab implementation for digit recognition

The main.m file loads the data, initialize the parameters, train the network and check the accuracy of the model

 - The input to the network is 20x20 image.
 - The network has one hidden layer with 25 hidden units
 - The output is a 10x1 probability vector for eah digit ("0" is mapped to "10")
